Explore ready-to-run examples that show how the pieces fit together.

## Available projects

- [Simple Example](/examples/simple-example) &mdash; Minimal API with validation, middleware, and generated OpenAPI.
- [Frontend Example](/examples/frontend-example) &mdash; Full-stack workspace with SvelteKit consuming a TS API Kit backend.

## Ideas for custom forks

- Wire in an ORM (Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely) and persist data across restarts.
- Add authentication using JWTs or session cookies via middleware.
- Deploy the backend to edge environments and measure cold-start performance.
- Replace the manual frontend client with generated Remote Functions once the tooling is available.

Clone an example, `pnpm install`, and you are ready to experiment.
