TS API Kit ships as a small family of packages that cover the entire workflow: build the API runtime, generate OpenAPI documents, and (soon) scaffold frontend clients.

## Runtime

- [@ts-api-kit/core](/packages/ts-api-core) &mdash; file-based router, validation pipeline, response helpers, and development server.

## Tooling

- [@ts-api-kit/compiler](/packages/ts-api-compiler) &mdash; CLI and programmatic OpenAPI generator.
- [openapi-to-remote](/packages/openapi-to-remote) &mdash; coming soon: generate SvelteKit Remote Functions directly from your spec.

## Next steps

Pick the package you need above or head back to the [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start).
